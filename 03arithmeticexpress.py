# Question 3: Simple Arithmetic Expressions
# Write a Python program that asks the user for three numbers.
# Store them in variables.
# Calculate the result of (first + second) * third.
# Print the result.

n1 = eval(input("Input num1: "))
n2 = eval(input("Input num2: "))
n3 = eval(input("Input num3: "))

print("(n1 + n2) * n3 =", (n1 + n2) * n3)
